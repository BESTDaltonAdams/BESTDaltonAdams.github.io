<h1>Week Seven</h1>
<h2>Slicer Big</h2>
<p>This week was a continuation of the previous week, just this time it was supersized.</p>

<h3>1. Fixing my Fusion File</h3>
<p>Though my model was a complete success last week, It was a bit difficult to get the middle sized slices into place, so I added an additional segment in the middle (seen below) to space things out a little better. You still have to slide the middle sized slices in at an angle, but this time they went in much easier. I also could not scale up this model linerally. It kept feeling out of proportion. Something about linerally scalling circles is not so successful, so I made additional changes until I was happy with my work.</p>

<h3>2. Nesting Slices</h3>
<p>After fixing my Fusion360 file, I once again used FusionSlicer to get my cut designs. See Week 6 for a full explinaion.</p>
<p>We were still working with the same size cardboard as last time, but with the projects being so much bigger I had to use a couple more sheets. But like before, I started by making new files of the exaxt size of the cardboard.</p>
<img src="Images7/nesting1.png" alt="nesting1" style="width:90%">
<p>Once again, after opening all of my new slicer files, I ungrouped all of the segments, the deleted the outer boarder.</p>
<img src="Images7/nesting2.png" alt="nesting2" style="width:90%">
<p>Because of the odd shape of my hour glass, there was no easy way to nest these shapes, but I did my best, and out of 3 sheets, only one had a segment of scrap worth sectioning off. This can be seen below</p>
<img src="Images7/nesting3.png" alt="nesting3" style="width:90%">
<p>Like last week, the text and the shapes were separated using the "select -> same -> stroke color" command and then moved onto two different layers.</p>
<img src="Images7/nesting4.png" alt="nesting4" style="width:90%">
<p>Then, as always, the stroke weight of everything was set to .01 mm so that everything would cut as a vector.</p>
<img src="Images7/nesting5.png" alt="nesting5" style="width:90%">

<h3>3. Cutting and Assembly</h3>
<p>I feel the need to reiterate, COVID-19 sucks. Because of COVID, I was unable to print my slices myslef. Instead, the omnipotent and multi-cosmic Madison had to will my slices into existence and transport them via telekinesis to a pick-up location.The photos of construction however are below. Again, I apologise for picture quality, but a full week later (I'd hate to ruin the illusion of time) I am still without power.</p>
<p>As before, I assmebled all of the pieces together and sorted by size and shape.</p>
<img src="Images7/Large_Assembly1.JPG" alt="assembly1" style="width:90%">
<p>Next assemble the largest segments</p>
<img src="Images7/Large_Assembly2.JPG" alt="assembly2" style="width:90%">
<p>Followed by the middle sized segments. Once again, these must be slid in at an angle.</p>
<img src="Images7/Large_Assembly3.JPG" alt="assembly3" style="width:90%">
<p> </p>
<img src="Images7/Large_Assembly4.JPG" alt="assembly4" style="width:90%">
<p>Finally complete the hour glass by inserting the smallest segments. You can also get a sense of size in the second photo</p>
<img src="Images7/Large_Assembly5.JPG" alt="assembly5" style="width:90%">
<img src="Images7/Large_Assembly6.JPG" alt="assembly6" style="width:90%">
<p>Look, two weeks of work to make two good friends.</p>
